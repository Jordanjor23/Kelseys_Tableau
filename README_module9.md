## 🚀 Data preparation methodology 🧑‍💻
For my data preparation, I uploaded each .csv file to a Google Colab Juypter Notebook. I was able to replace each blank or null cell with the words "No Content." The method behind this is to have something in the cell that indicates that there is no content in the cell without adding 0s and skewing the data. 

## 🚀 Indicator selection criteria ✔️
For the data, I chose to join the "WDI_country.csv" file and the "WDICSV.csv" file. The common field that formed the relationship was "Country Code." This field allowed for the two .csv files to be joined in Tableau. In the joined table, I was able to evaluate the data and decide which columns and rows would be relevant to the overall analysis. I noticed that the data had a lot of information, therefore, I would have to find a way to organize my analysis and narrow down the analysis to several themes: finance, agriculture, and energy. I utilized filters like year, income level, and region for my visualizations, which illuminated a lot about the dataset.

## 🚀 Corresponding Visuals with themes:

**4 themes present:**  economy, agriculture, technology, and environment

- Trade 1, 2, and 3 theme is economic growth. Visual type: stacked bar graph and bar graph (**three visuals here**)
- `Global pop theme: Economic/environmental metrics visual type: map (categorized by color and year)
- Cleantech theme: agriculture/technology metrics visual type: map (categorized by color and year)
- Agricult Middle East and North Africa theme: Agriculture visual type: pie
- Agriculture Europe and Central Asia theme: Agriculture visual type: bar (Categorized by income level, agriculture census, and region)
- Global Income level theme: Economic metrics visual type: pie (categorized by income level and region)
- Europe Finance Info theme: Economy metrics, visual type: pie (categorized by income level and region)

 **Three Dashboards were noted in the presentation:** The income Level Dashboard, Trade Dashboard, Clean Tech, and Trade Dashboard)

## 🚀 Statistical methods used 📉
I evaluated the data set using statistical methods like mean and variance. I always like to find the average first so that I can use it as the middle value and see how other statistical values like the max, min, and variance align. I found that there was not as much quantitative data as qualitative data in the data set.So, I utilized the value count in the WDI.csv as my quantitative metric. 


## 🚀  Data limitations ⚠️
The data limitations were mainly that there was not a lot of quantitative data in the data set. I utilized the value count as a quantitative metric; however, there was a lot of information about energy, reproductive rights, energy, and trade in the data set. However, there were not quantitative metrics
for all of those categories.

## 🚀 Future Analysis Reccomendations🔮

In the future, I recommend having a better balance of quantitative and qualitative data for future analysis. I really wanted to dive into reproductive rights by region and dive further into trade as the topic of the dataset was very interesting.
