## 🚀 Data preparation methodology 🧑‍💻
For my data preparation, I uploaded each .csv file to a Google Colab Juypter Notebook. I was able to replace each blank or null cell with the words "No Content." The method behind this is to have something in the cell that indicates that there is no content in the cell without adding 0s and skewing the data. 

## 🚀 Indicator selection criteria ✔️
For the data, I chose to join the "WDI_country.csv" file and the "WDICSV.csv" file. The common filed that formed the relationship was "Country Code." This field allowed for the two .csv files to be joined in Tableau. In the joined table, I was able to evaluate the data and decide which columns and rows would be relvant to the overall analysis. I noticed that the data had a lot of information, therefore, I would have to find a way to organize my analysis and narrow down the analysis to several themes being: finance, agrigculture, and energy. I ended up utilizing filters like year, income level, and region for my visualzations, which illumniated a lot about the dataset.


## 🚀 Statistical methods used 📉
I utilized statstical methods like mean and variance to evaluate the data set. I always like to find the average of the data set first so that I can utilize it as the middle value of the data set and see how other statistical values like the max, min and variance align. I found that there was not as much quantitative data as qualtiative data in the data set.So, I utilize the value count in the WDI.csv as my quantitaive metric. 


## 🚀  Data limitations ⚠️
The data limitations were mainly that there was not a lot of quantitaive data in the data set. I utilized the value count as a quuantitave metric; however, there was a lot of information about energy, reproductive rights, energy, and trade in the data set. However, there were not quantitaive metrics
for all of those categories.

## 🚀 Future Analysis Reccomendations🔮

In the future, I reccomend having a better balance of quantitaive and qualtiative data for future analysis. I really wanted to dive into reproductive rights by region and dive further into trade as the topic of the dataset was very interesting.
